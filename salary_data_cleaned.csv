From food to home to news and technology and more, we represent the influential voices who make the internet a better place. As the largest exclusive publisher network, with direct access to code-on-page and underlying datasets, we have a unique capability to build innovative products that span across publishers, advertisers and consumers.

This position can be in-office in New York City or work-from-home. Remote U.S. candidates encouraged to apply.

This Software Engineer role is focused on the development and optimization of systems and tools we use to operate our business. These processes include but are not limited to those used to acquire, onboard, integrate with, manage, and support our customers. Given the broad scope of this effort, a successful candidate must be driven by understanding and improving work processes and developing solutions that potentially use a wide variety of technologies. For example, some solutions may involve extending or developing a web-based application using Angular and node.js, while other solutions may involve the integration of enterprise systems using golang, python, or some other language and technology stack. We are treating this effort as we treat all of our product development efforts, using agile methods to deliver incremental value to the business.

Skills and Experience
While we do not fixate on number of years of experience, we expect it will take at least 5 years doing professional software development on internal tools, enterprise platforms, or similar systems to excel in this role.
Full-stack web development, meaning use of front-end frameworks like Angular, and development of back-end services in node.js, potentially integrating with persistent stores like postgresql.
Experience integrating with enterprise CRM systems like Salesforce.com.
Experience with building and operating software in the public cloud, specifically AWS.
Experience and passion for developing business-critical solutions for an internal user base.
Qualities

Beyond experience in a software engineering role, we focus on the qualities we feel are important to success on our team. These include:
Proactive/Follows through--opportunities for work optimization may not always be fully formed or completely spelled out. You need to take the lead on conceiving solutions and seeing them through to delivery and actual usage.
Communication, especially cross-functionally--you will be working on internal systems used by a variety of people doing very different kinds of work and being adept at communication will be key.
Enjoys improving processes and workflows--this is the essence of this role. More than interest in any specific technology, you must be driven by optimizing work.
Adaptable/Flexible--decisions about where to apply technology are based on ROI calculations, and that could lead to changes in direction as new opportunities are discovered. An agile mindset is key.
Versatile, especially with technologies; a tinkerer--the variety of software you develop could run a wide gamut, so you need to excel at taking on new challenges outside your comfort zone.
Curious, likes to explore alternatives--understanding your users and the work they do should be compelling to you. You want to wear their shoes and think about different ways to tackle their work.
Pragmatic--delivering value quickly and incrementally is favored over longer efforts that defer value delivery. You get things done quickly and learn from experience.
Resourceful--sometimes the best solutions involve leveraging a variety of resources already in play, or researching how others solve similar problems.
Open minded--some problems may seem impossibly challenging, or the solution might not be obvious. Being open minded to explore options is important here.
Driven--your desire to help others and optimize solutions is intrinsic and second nature to you.
CafeMedia is committed to diversity, equity, and inclusion. We believe we are most impactful when people with a wide range of backgrounds, experiences, and identities come together with common purpose. We encourage candidates from all backgrounds to apply.

More about Ezoic
Ezoic is an inaugural member of the Google Certified Publishing Partner Program. This means we work closely with Google to help websites optimize their ad revenue. We actually have won awards directly from Google for the artificial intelligence that we've built. Cool, right?!?
Our technology reaches tens of millions of people every month and adoption is growingly quickly. Ezoic is a technology-first company. Our CEO is a developer by trade, and our engineers are given all the tools needed to succeed. We empower our engineers to make a lot of their own decisions about both design and implementation, and encourage them to come up with new ideas to improve the application. We also aim to keep a good work-life balance, based on our philosophy that happy engineers are more productive. We want you to be working on something that you are passionate about and allow engineers to move around to keep things fresh.
While we are all working remotely now because of Covid, we have a brand new office in Carlsbad, CA, where we plan to return next year sometimes when the world goes back to normal. Every engineer works at their own quad-monitor setup on a standing desk. We pride ourselves on getting stuff done, but when you need a break, Ezoic offers great perks, including unlimited vacation time, catered lunches, snacks, flexible hours, ping pong, video games, and pool.
The Ezoic Platform:
Our platform is essentially made up of 4 parts:
A large data store (primarily Redshift) that tracks everything imaginable about user interactions with content.
A machine learning / decision layer (tensorflow, sklearn, python & custom written in Go (golang)) that analyzes all that data.
A decision / adaptation layer that takes the insights and actions upon them by changing what content / ads / features are displayed when, to who and how. (Primarily written in Go)
A reporting system and series of “apps” that provide various functionality and presents what we are doing to our customers. (MySQL / Vue.js / Go)
We are a small team, so there are opportunities to work on all aspects of our platform depending on your interests and skills. We want you to be successful here and will ensure that our smart people are working on things that they find meaningful.

"Software Engineer, Applications Team",$81K-$141K (Glassdoor est.),"Over the coming years, biotech will fundamentally rewrite the way we live. Gene editing and cell therapy are dramatically changing how we treat cancer and other major illnesses. Biofuels and biomaterials are transforming the cars we drive, the clothes we wear, and the makeup of everyday objects. Crop science and synthetic biology are producing sustainable and ethical food. Benchling's mission is to accelerate the research that propels us towards this reality, and magnify its impact, through modern software.

Every day, hundreds of thousands of scientists around the world use Benchling in their efforts to solve humanity's most pressing problems. For these scientists, Benchling is the central technology they use to conduct their research.


Benchling was founded by a team of MIT graduates and has raised funding from Benchmark, Andreessen Horowitz, Thrive Capital, and Y Combinator. Our customers include pharmaceutical giants, leading biotechs, and the world's most renowned research institutes.

Our engineering team is comprised of the Applications Team, the Platform Team, and the Customer Engineering Team. The Applications Team is responsible for the product modules used directly by scientists to work with their data inside Benchling. This includes DNA editing tools, an electronic lab notebook, sample tracking, workflow design, and more.

WHAT YOU WILL DO
Own projects end-to-end, from initial design, to prototype, to large-scale rollout.
Design and implement backend models and API endpoints for complex scientific workflows.
Design and implement rich frontend components and architecture. We build and operate one of the largest, richest React applications out there and power complex scientific analyses.
Work closely with product managers, designers, marketing, and sales to ensure the right context is being shared.
Help rapidly scale our product and team. As a member of the engineering team, you'll be an integral part of how we mature our tooling, best practices, engineering processes, and hiring.
ABOUT YOU
Have 3-5 years of experience in software engineering.
Build software with a product-first approach. You ship code quickly and care about the real world impact of your code.
Have strong abilities in problem solving and iterating on feedback.
Enjoy ownership and building key pieces of product.
Are interested in learning more about life science (prior knowledge is not required; desire to learn is a must).
YOU MIGHT WORK ON

Check out our engineering blog for some examples of past work. Here are some other examples of recent and future projects:
Tools to simulate DNA assembly - computers can assist scientists by informing scientific decisions with complex calculations. Our bulk assembly tool allows scientists to simulate constructing hundreds of DNA constructs in parallel, visualizing the end result and highlighting potential issues.
Chemistry tools - we have focused primarily on biology and biotech for the last 5 years, but are just starting new initiatives to expand our tools to support chemists as well. This will involve modeling complex chemical reactions within Benchling, and is a opportunity to see a new product grow from the ground up.
Robot and machine integration - scientists are increasingly using automated hardware in the lab to perform measurements. By integrating Benchling with machines like liquid handlers, we are working towards a world where a scientist can perform a physical experiment entirely using software.
OUR VALUES
Empower through information. We explain the ""why"" behind every decision, unless there are highly sensitive circumstances. We're honest about how we're doing, especially in difficult times. We believe that sharing information builds trust and enables better decision-making.
Rely on tenacity. Hard work is one of the greatest factors to determine success and is fully under our control. We must make the most of every day by bringing the highest level of determination. Dreaming big is not enough.
Raise the bar. Pushing ourselves and others to improve will be uncomfortable and at times result in failure. However, it's critical to our success. We're dedicated to creating a place where everyone feels challenged to improve.
Build a lever. We choose to build tools and infrastructure that will help others make world-changing innovations. There's less glory in it, but in the words of Archimedes, ""Give me a lever long enough and a fulcrum on which to place it, and I shall move the world.""

You’ll rely on object-oriented principles and solid coding practices as the foundation of everything we build. Our stack includes apps and services in PHP, Javascript / Node.js,Python, Kotlin, and Swift.
Take the next step in your career as you leverage your prior experience to mentor other engineers and contribute to the culture of our team through technical and people leadership.
You’ll join and help shape a team of full stack engineers that embraces DevOps not just as jargon but as a philosophy. Expect to be a part of zero-downtime deployments to our highly available infrastructure on AWS.

About Us
Presbyterian Healthcare Services is a locally owned, not-for-profit healthcare system of nine hospitals, a statewide health plan and a growing multi-specialty medical group. Founded in New Mexico in 1908, it is the state's largest private employer with approximately 11,000 employees.
Presbyterian's story is really the story of the remarkable people who have chosen to work here. Starting with Reverend Cooper who began our journey in 1908, the hard work of thousands of physicians, employees, board members, and other volunteers brought Presbyterian from a tiny tuberculosis sanatorium to a statewide healthcare system, serving more than 700,000 New Mexicans.

We are part of New Mexico's history - and committed to its future. That is why we will continue to work just as hard and care just as deeply to serve New Mexico for years to come.

About New Mexico
New Mexico's unique blend of Spanish, Mexican and Native American influences contribute to a culturally rich lifestyle. Add in Albuquerque's International Balloon Fiesta, Los Alamos' nuclear scientists, Roswell's visitors from outer space, and Santa Fe's artists, and you get an eclectic mix of people, places and experiences that make this state great.

Cities in New Mexico are continually ranked among the nation's best places to work and live by Forbes magazine, Kiplinger's Personal Finance, and other corporate and government relocation managers like Worldwide ERC.

New Mexico offers endless recreational opportunities to explore, and enjoy an active lifestyle. Venture off the beaten path, challenge your body in the elements, or open yourself up to the expansive sky. From hiking, golfing and biking to skiing, snowboarding and boating, it's all available among our beautiful wonders of the west.

About You

You have experience with Web APIs. In this role, you'll be working with many different APIs. You'll need to be able to dig into their documentation, build proof-of-concepts, and then build complex integrations with those APIs. Basically, you'll need to know and love Web APIs.

You are a skilled programmer. You don't expect to come up with designs and leave implementation to others. Instead, you dig in and get stuff done. Our main tech stack is Node and Python, you'll be working with both.

You solve problems. Engineers write lots of code, but that is not all they do. You can recognize when something isn't working and do the work to figure out how to fix it. This could be with code, or by working with your teammates.

You are a skilled written communicator. Zapier is a 100% remote team and being able to communicate well is critical. Chat and video are our primary means of communication. You can communicate unfamiliar technical topics clearly and in an approachable way.

You want to do what's best for users. Integrations are at the core of Zapier's value to our customers, and we want to keep building ones that are of the highest quality and solve our customers' needs.

Your experience lifts others up. You love assisting others and use your prior experiences to mentor, no matter how many or how few you have.

You understand that perfect is the enemy of the good. One of our core values is defaulting to action. You can ship code and systems that just work and work simply, while iterating as needed to get towards better solutions.

Things You Might Do

Zapier is a small, fast-growing, and remote-first company, so you'll likely get experience on many different projects across the organization. That said, here are some things you'll probably do:
Build and maintain our partner API and SDKs
Work with partners' APIs or frameworks to build bespoke integrations on external platforms
Scope and break down complex technical features
Dig into bugs and feature requests
Help consult on and design newer features for our partners
Work with our partnerships team to solve problems for high-value partners
Be comfortable taking technical calls with external partners
Ship code to millions of users every week
Help other engineers on the team and across Zapier
Maintain and continuously optimize our existing partner products
You have four plus years of Engineering experience
As a part of Zapier's all-hands philosophy, help customers via support to ensure they have the best experience possible.
Travel - as part of our remote-first lifestyle, it's important that we come together 2-3x per year to work together, meet each other in person and have fun together. These meetings are in North America and mandatory, so please keep that in mind when you apply.
How To Apply

We have a non-standard application process. To jump-start the process we ask a few questions we usually would ask at the start of an interview. This helps speed up the process and lets us get to know you a bit better right out of the gate.

After you apply, you are going to hear back from us, even if we don't seem like a good fit. In fact, throughout the process, we strive to make sure you never go more than seven days without hearing from us.

About Zapier

Since 2011, Zapier has been helping people across the world automate the boring and tedious parts of their job. We do that by helping everyone connect the web applications they already use and love.

We believe that there are jobs a computer is best at doing and that there are jobs a human is best at doing. We want to empower businesses to create processes and systems that let computers do what they are best at doing and let humans do what they are best at doing.

We believe that with the right tools, you can have a significant impact with less hassle.

We believe in small teams. Small teams are fast and nimble. Small groups mean less bureaucracy and less management and more getting things done.

We believe in a safe, welcoming, and inclusive environment. All teammates at Zapier agree to a code of conduct.

More about Apptegy

Apptegys mission is to help school leaders share the story of every student. Amazing moments are happening in school districts, but those moments rarely become stories that reach the community. Our products empower school leaders and educators to share those stories and run better schools.

Our unique value is with our publishing platform, Thrillshare, that allows schools to update all of their online communication from one place. Schools can write a message once, and Thrillshare automatically updates their iPhone app, Android app, website, Twitter, Facebook, text messages, and voice calls.

What its like to work at Apptegy

Working at Apptegy is different. For many of our team members, working here is unlike anything theyve experienced. We have an entire floor to ourselves in the Simmons Building (the tallest in Arkansas), where we have a great time, and get to work with school districts and schools across the U.S.

Were not going about building a company the easy way. Scaling a rapidly growing startup is difficult, but we wouldnt have it any other way. If the challenge excites you as much as it does us, come learn more about what we're building and what it takes to be part of Apptegy: Thoughtfulness and High Performance.

Thoughtfulness

Internally, we look for chances to make each others days. Noticing someone needs a pick-me-up, remembering birthdays, and celebrating others success all help strengthen our internal bonds. Externally, we want to amaze people with how much we care about both the products we build and the services we provide that happens by noticing and acting on opportunities to value others.

High Performance

What we are trying to accomplish is hard. While thoughtfulness is central to how we engage others, a personal ethic of high performance is needed across the company for us to succeed. High performance is a major focus in every role across the company.

Social security, our nation's retirement safety net, is projected to be insolvent as soon as 2035, making employer-sponsored 401(k) plans the primary retirement savings vehicle in the U.S. Nearly half of all working Americans are not saving enough for their future because they are employed by a company that doesn't offer a retirement plan. Human Interest is changing that by making it affordable and accessible for small and medium sized businesses to offer employees a path to financial independence through retirement savings.

Our values are the guiding principles we use to build solutions for plan administrators and participants. They reflect our point of view on what's important and what's right:
In it for customers, autonomous & accountable, outcomes driven, inclusive collaboration, and decisive.
As a member of the Recordkeeping team, you will get to help build our financial engine.

As reliability is key to earning our customers' trust, you will build robust systems that are observable, maintainable, and scalable.
What you get to do everyday:
Build and maintain business-critical software to process and record customers' retirement savings
Improve complex processes and systems to make them more robust and require less human intervention
Collaborate with other engineers and stakeholders to share knowledge and build expertise
Write clean, high-quality code and tests while keeping the system fast and reliable
Develop ownership over the record keeping domain and make informed engineering tradeoffs
Delight internal and external stakeholders
Participate in development life cycle activities like design, coding, testing and production release

Minimum 3 years of professional experience building and maintaining web application
Experience with one or more technologies (e.g. Node, TypeScript, React, Heroku)
Strong desire to learn, think creatively, and share knowledge with others
Ability to write understandable, testable code with an eye towards maintainability
Proactive and empathetic mindset - you love to roll up your sleeves to fix problems for our customers
Please feel free to apply to this position even if you do not meet 100% of the requirements listed above.

Build and maintain business-critical software to process and record customers' retirement savings

Furthermore, employees in New Mexico need to pass a U.S. Air Force background screen for access to Kirtland Air Force Base. Substance abuse or illegal drug use, falsification of information, criminal activity, serious misconduct or other indicators of untrustworthiness can cause access to be denied or terminated, resulting in the inability to perform the duties assigned and subsequent termination of employment.
If hired without a clearance and it subsequently becomes necessary to obtain and maintain one for the position, or you bid on positions that require a clearance, a pre-processing background review may be conducted prior to a required federal background investigation. Applicants for a DOE security clearance need to be U.S. citizens.

The UPIV process will include the completion of a USAccess Enrollment, SF-85 (Questionnaire for Non-Sensitive Positions) and OF-306 (Declaration of for Federal Employment). An unfavorable UPIV determination will result in immediate retrieval of the SNL issued badge, removal of cyber (logical) access and/or removal from SNL subcontract. All MOWs may appeal the unfavorable UPIV determination to DOE/NNSA immediately. If the appeal is unsuccessful, the MOW may try to go through the UPIV process one year after the decision date.

If hired without a clearance and it subsequently becomes necessary to obtain and maintain one for the position, or you bid on positions that require a clearance, a pre-processing background review may be conducted prior to a required federal background investigation. Applicants for a DOE security clearance need to be U.S. citizens. If you hold more than one citizenship (i.e., of the U.S. and another country), your ability to obtain a security clearance may be impacted.
Members of the workforce (MOWs) hired at Sandia who require uncleared access for greater than 179 days during their employment, are required to go through the Uncleared Personal Identity Verification (UPIV) process. Access includes physical and/or cyber (logical) access, as well as remote access to any NNSA information technology (IT) systems. UPIV requirements are not applicable to individuals who require a DOE personnel security clearance for the performance of their SNL employment or to foreign nationals. The UPIV process will include the completion of a USAccess Enrollment, SF-85 (Questionnaire for Non-Sensitive Positions) and OF-306 (Declaration of for Federal Employment). An unfavorable UPIV determination will result in immediate retrieval of the SNL issued badge, removal of cyber (logical) access and/or removal from SNL subcontract. All MOWs may appeal the unfavorable UPIV determination to DOE/NNSA immediately. If the appeal is unsuccessful, the MOW may try to go through the UPIV process one year after the decision date.

Location: We are open to hiring candidates who are located anywhere in the U.S.

Visa Sponsorship: At this time, it is unlikely that we will be able to provide sponsorships for visas for this position.
This means a few things:
We are solving some pretty cool data access problems (ex. how do you extract, host and visualize every taxi ride in NYC so that any resident, anywhere can access it?).
What we do matters. New York, Seattle, San Francisco and 300+ other cities, states and counties use us to connect citizens with information that matters to their day to day life.

Qualifications
We would love to talk to you if you…
Care about scalable, robust, well-tested code.
Have experience with at least one statically typed language like Scala, Elixir, Java, Go or C++
You have significant HTML, CSS, and JavaScript experience - at least 4 years for our current need for team members with more experience. We are currently using React/ES2016 supported by Redux, jQuery, Lodash, Typescript and Ruby on Rails.

Are comfortable working in a heterogeneous development environment where you’ll be working with multiple development languages and technologies
Please apply if you share our beliefs that:
You code your way out of problems, don’t talk about them.
It’s healthy to laugh at yourself.
A flat tire is just an opportunity to change a tire and keep going.
Hard work is necessary. Smart work and long hours are all appropriate, but not a way of life.
There are no experts, just people who are constantly working toward becoming one.
Buzz words like ""think-piece, charette or cross-functional synergy” have no place in an engineering team.
You make the most progress as a team, and teams aren’t built out of people who want to shout the loudest.
Checking in code is part of progress, solving customer problems is having impact.

Social security, our nation's retirement safety net, is projected to be insolvent as soon as 2035, making employer-sponsored 401(k) plans the primary retirement savings vehicle in the U.S. Nearly half of all working Americans are not saving enough for their future because they are employed by a company that doesn't offer a retirement plan. Human Interest is changing that by making it affordable and accessible for small and medium sized businesses to offer employees a path to financial independence through retirement savings.

Our values are the guiding principles we use to build solutions for plan administrators and participants. They reflect our point of view on what's important and what's right:
In it for customers, autonomous & accountable, outcomes driven, inclusive collaboration, and decisive.
As a member of the Recordkeeping team, you will get to help build our financial engine. You will collaborate with domain experts to design, build, test, and own systems and processes for servicing 401(k) plans and making our customers happy. As reliability is key to earning our customers' trust, you will build robust systems that are observable, maintainable, and scalable.
What you get to do everyday:
Build and maintain business-critical software to process and record customers' retirement savings
Improve complex processes and systems to make them more robust and require less human intervention
Collaborate with other engineers and stakeholders to share knowledge and build expertise
Write clean, high-quality code and tests while keeping the system fast and reliable
Develop ownership over the record keeping domain and make informed engineering tradeoffs
Delight internal and external stakeholders
Participate in development life cycle activities like design, coding, testing and production release
What you bring to the role:
Minimum 3 years of professional experience building and maintaining web application
Experience with one or more technologies (e.g. Node, TypeScript, React, Heroku)
Strong desire to learn, think creatively, and share knowledge with others
Ability to write understandable, testable code with an eye towards maintainability
Proactive and empathetic mindset - you love to roll up your sleeves to fix problems for our customers
Please feel free to apply to this position even if you do not meet 100% of the requirements listed above.

About Human Interest:
We are a high-growth, Series C-funded company on a mission to change the retirement industry.

At Files.com, we’re building a cloud storage service that challenges the status quo through many unique features that really help people and businesses boost their productivity.

We are looking for Rubyists with strong backgrounds in data structures, algorithms, and scaling to join our team and help us build features into our already great app.

Read on to learn more!

About Files.com


Files.com is a cloud storage and file logistics service with over 1,500 paying business customers, including Target, Canonical, UPS, Leica, DirecTV, GoPro, Marriott, and more.

Our company consists of USA-based remote employees who work from home.

We’re Bootstrapped, Profitable, and Growing


Our success comes from building a great service that solves problems for
our customers, and our growth comes from expanding and
improving our products as quickly as we can.

We believe that great products can only be built by great people.
So we’re on a quest to find the smartest, most creative, and most
motivated people, and create an environment in which
they thrive.

We Are A Remote Company


You will work from home and have some flexibility to choose your
working hours, allowing you to make time for family, recreation,
vacations, or anything that is important to you.

You’ll take off 11 company-wide holidays per year as well as 20
days of PTO for vacations. You’ll have the time to take longer
vacations and have fun.

As our employees’ safety is a top priority, and we want to ensure we do not further spread COVID-19, we have paused all company travel. Once it is safe to resume travelling, you’ll travel to in-person meetings with your team and the entire
company to meet and work together face to face. These meetings are in
cities around the US, including Austin, Orlando, New Orleans, San Diego, Las Vegas, and New York City.

We think that these in-person meetings are vital to the success of a
remote team.

About the Role


As a Serverside Developer at Files.com, you will take the lead on helping build cutting edge features into the Files.com product that drive value for the 1,700 business that use our platform for collaboration.

Our API receives hundreds of requests per second and is used by both internal and external developers.

Implementing Single-Sign-On via OAuth, SAML, and SCIM.
Implementing in-file search using Elasticsearch with custom input filters to index a plethora of document types.
Building a scalable engine that can convert nearly any type of files to PDF for in-browser previews (like the former Crocodoc service).
Upgrading our API documentation to be automatically generated using the OpenAPI standard, and the creation of automatically-generated SDKs.
Building our Universal Sync engine, which is a tool that allows Files.com users to synchronize their files to other cloud services such as S3, Azure, and Rackspace.

Appreciation for testing and the ability to write specs using RSpec.
Preferred Qualifications:


Participation in open source Ruby gem projects, including ideally being the maintainer for a Gem that sees large usage in the community.
Strong experience working at scale.
Our Core Beliefs


Here are just some of our Core Beliefs:

We believe that the best Engineers tend to be polyglots with a wide
variety of programming language experience. We don’t hire for specific
programming language skills, but rather look for engineers who are
fluent in several programming languages. We want our staff to be
adaptable and ready to evolve to what’s next.

We believe in using the right tool for the job. Our core applications
are built in Ruby, JavaScript, Java, C++, and PHP. We use Rails, React,
Chef, Qt, Jenkins, Github, Honeybadger, CircleCI, Maven, AWS, MySQL,
Redis, Memcached, Haml, Sass, and many other exciting open source
systems. We don’t want to get stuck in the trap of using a language or a
tool just because “that’s how it’s done around here.”

We believe that open-source only works if companies give back. If you
work on any open-source projects during the course of your work at
Files.com, you are encouraged to submit your improvements as a pull
request back to the upstream project. And if you build something from
scratch while working here that’s generic and not related to our core
products, we want you to release that on GitHub too. We’ll also pay
your travel costs to any conference where you can get a speaking gig.

We believe in building products that we actually use ourselves. We are
our own toughest critics and we put all of our products through their
paces every day.

Salary, Pay, and Benefits


Files.com offers industry-leading salaries based on experience combined with unparalleled flexibility and other benefits to secure top talent.

You’ll take off 11 company-wide holidays per year as well as 20 days of PTO for vacations. Go have fun. Don’t work all the time.

We will provide you a laptop and a $1,000 signing bonus to purchase a new monitor, desk, or anything else that would help build or refresh your home office.

We’ll update your salary annually based on your performance, as reviewed by your peers.

We fully pay base plan health insurance premiums (exact plan details depend on your state of residence), and we’ll pick up the tab for 75% of your spouse or dependents if they wish to join your chosen plan. We want your family to be healthy.
